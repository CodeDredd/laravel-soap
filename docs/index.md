# Introduction

This package provides an expressive, minimal API around the [Soap Client from Phpro](https://github.com/phpro/soap-client), allowing you to quickly make outgoing SOAP requests to communicate with other web applications.
It is using [HTTPplug](http://httplug.io/) as handler with [Guzzle](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle6-adapter) as client.
Some code is based/copied on/from [Laravel Http wrapper](https://github.com/illuminate/http). Thanks for inspiration :-)
